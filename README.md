# PySpam

I made this PySpam spamming bot with Python for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It uses the [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) library to create a desktop GUI.

## Features

- Send a custom message multiple times automatically.
- Adjustable typing speed.
- Simple and clean user interface.
- Force stop anytime by pressing the `ESC` key.

## How It Works

1. Enter the message you want to spam.
2. Set the number of times to send the message.
3. Adjust the typing speed (1 = fastest, 9 = slowest).
4. Click "Start Spam".
5. Switch to the target window (e.g., chat app) within 5 seconds.
6. The bot will start typing and sending your message automatically.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install pywebview pyautogui keyboard
   ```

2. **Run the bot:**

   ```sh
   python PySpam.py
   ```

3. **Stop the bot:**
   - Press and hold the `ESC` key at any time to stop spamming.
